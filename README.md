pedestrians-traffic-calc
========================

Created during #douhack 2013 in Donetsk.

See demo for this here:

Application is created with OpenCV library (for Java) and Processing framework.

It contains a lot of hacks and there is much to improve.

Next things author wants to check:

1. Use and improve camshift algorithm for object tracking.
2. Remove noise with checking speed of moved objects.
3. Play with different tracking algorithms (including BackgroundSubtractorMOG2 which is ported to OpenCV 3)
4. Play with "segmentMotion" and "calcGlobalOrientation" to identify moved pieces more carefully.

Please, contact myself at on Twitter: @MaximGalushka if you are interested in this project and want to learn OpenCV and object recognition techniquest with me.

Big thanks to #douhack and Binary studio in Donetsk for hosting this event!
